/// Benchmark results are intentionally not stored or otherwise used. Without this function, release optimizations may

/// The non-inlined function boundary helps prevent the benchmark closure from making that assumption, while
/// `extendLifetime` keeps the value alive through the call without requiring an empty closure.
