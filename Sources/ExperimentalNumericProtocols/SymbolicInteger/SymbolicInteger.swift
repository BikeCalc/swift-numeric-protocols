/// A bounded integer value expressed through a symbolic textual notation.
///
/// A symbolic integer represents exact, discrete values without promising a binary representation or bit-level
/// operations. Conforming types provide a lossless textual notation, define their lower and upper bounds, support
/// arithmetic with overflow reporting, and advance across their representable values by a stride.
///
/// The storage used by a conforming type is an implementation detail. A symbolic integer may use a binary integer
/// internally while presenting a nonpositional notation publicly.
