/// A type that represents a finite or nonfinite rational value as a ratio of two binary integer terms.

/// A rational value has a numerator, which appears above the fraction bar, and a denominator, which appears below it. A
/// zero denominator represents infinity when the numerator is nonzero and NaN when the numerator is zero. Conforming
/// types may preserve distinct representations of the same canonical value. For example, `1/1` and `2/2` may be unequal
/// stored values while remaining canonically equal rational values. A conforming type determines whether it preserves
/// or canonicalizes equivalent nonfinite representations.

/// Conforming types support Swift's standard numeric operations, ordering, hashing, integer literals, and textual
/// descriptions. They also support the four basic arithmetic operations, canonicalization, and canonical equality
